Sets is a small utility for doing set operations
(difference, union, symmetric difference and intersection)
on a set of strings provided on the command line
or read from files.

Its really only useful to experiences UNIX shell users
and is the sort of utility you do not know you need
until you use it, then you cannot do without it.

If you find this useful or want to gripe, email me.
